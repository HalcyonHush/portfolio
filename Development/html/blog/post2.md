There was a list before this.

You know what? It is beets. I've crashed into a beet truck. Did he just throw my cat out of the window? God help us, we're in the hands of engineers. God creates dinosaurs. God destroys dinosaurs. God creates Man. Man destroys God. Man creates Dinosaurs.

Is this my espresso machine? Wh-what is-h-how did you get my espresso machine? Hey, take a look at the earthlings. Goodbye! You know what? It is beets. I've crashed into a beet truck. I was part of something special. Remind me to thank John for a lovely weekend.

God help us, we're in the hands of engineers. I gave it a cold? I gave it a virus. A computer virus. They're using our own satellites against us. And the clock is ticking. This thing comes fully loaded. AM/FM radio, reclining bucket seats, and... power windows.

Checkmate... God creates dinosaurs. God destroys dinosaurs. God creates Man. Man destroys God. Man creates Dinosaurs. I was part of something special. My dad once told me, laugh and the world laughs with you, Cry, and I'll give you something to cry about you little bastard!
