## Objective
Design and build a bookmaker's help pages.

## Background
I had recently left a job managing a bookmaker's internal knowledge base and wanted to focus my career more on the coding side of things.

Working with an environment I was already familiar with allowed me to quickly gauge my strengths and weaknesses and create a learning path to further my career.

My initial build was a purely HTML and CSS construction due to my previously limited JavaScript knowledge. Having identified this weakness I took steps to learn DOM manipulation with JavaScript.

## Challenges
1. Limited JavaScript knowledge
1. No website hosting experience

## Solutions
1. Completed the W3C Introduction to JavaScript course
1. Researched website hosting solutions, particularly Netlify and GitHub pages

## Retrospective

### Design
**Designing a web page is complicated**. When I set out to build this site, the design was only available in my head. This led to countless hours of moving elements 1 or 2 pixels to the left/right or completely rebuilding elements only to change my mind and revert the design.

A design should be in place before starting construction.

### Legacy browsers
**Browser support must be considered from the start of a project**. Internet Explorer was not in the initial scope in order to prevent myself from being overwhelmed. Retrospectively adding fallbacks and modifying code to use older syntaxes meant that a lot of things ended up being built twice.

Internet Explorer 11 must be considered from the very first line of code.

### Maintainability
**Things will change, plan ahead**. Each page was initially built individually without any sort of templating. This isolation meant that whenever the site's header, footer or other common sections changed, code had to be copied and pasted into each file.

A templating engine or similar should always be used.

### Deadlines
**A site will never be perfect**. I found myself tweaking things even after the site was complete. These changes may have felt good but they will likely go unnoticed by any visitors and any potential for learning will be far greater on a new unfamiliar project.

Deadlines and milestones should be set in advance.
