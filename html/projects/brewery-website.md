CSS Grid is amazing

## Objective
Using a reference image, build a <q>pixel perfect</q> landing page.

## Challenges
1. Previously only used SVGs as external images
1. Overlapping a text box with an image without hiding the text at different browser sizes

## Solutions
1. Learnt how to create inline SVGs
1. Used CSS Grid to keep content separate at all times

## Retrospective

### SVGs
**SVGs are complex**

### Browser differences
**Browsers implement things differently**. Internet Explorer does not support <code>justify-content: center</code>.
Used JavaScript with a resize event listener to centre the carousel in Internet Explorer

### Div elements
**There's no need to avoid Div elements**

### Object oriented JavaScript
**Don't lose sight of why you use something**
